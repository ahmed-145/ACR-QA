## 🔴 Critical Issues (High Severity)

⚠️ **These issues should be addressed immediately**

### 1. SECURITY-001 - security

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:126`

**Tool:** semgrep | **Rule:** [SECURITY-001](config/rules.yml)

**Issue:**
> Dangerous use of eval() or exec(). These functions execute arbitrary 
Python code and should NEVER be used with user input.


**AI Explanation:**

This code violates SECURITY-001: Dangerous eval() Usage. 
The issue is the use of the eval() function to evaluate user input, which allows arbitrary code execution. 
This matters because eval() is a code execution vulnerability that can lead to data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution, as stated in the rule rationale. 
To fix this, use ast.literal_eval() for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation, as recommended in the rule remediation.

**💡 How to Fix:**
> Use ast.literal_eval() for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation

<details>
<summary>📝 Example Fix (click to expand)</summary>

```python
import ast
# Safe for literals only (strings, numbers, lists, dicts)
data = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
```

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. PATTERN-001

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:100` | **Rule:** [PATTERN-001](config/rules.yml)

**Message:** Mutable default argument detected! This is a classic Python bug.
Default values are created ONCE when the function is defined.


**Explanation:** This code violates PATTERN-001, Mutable Default Argument, because the function `store_user_sessions` has a mutable default argument `sessions: Dict = {}`, which is created only once when the function is defined and shared across all function calls.

This matters because, as per the rule rationale...
