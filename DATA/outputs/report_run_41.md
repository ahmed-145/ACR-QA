## 🔴 Critical Issues (High Severity)

⚠️ **These issues should be addressed immediately**

### 1. SECURITY-001 - security

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:126`

**Tool:** semgrep | **Rule:** [SECURITY-001](config/rules.yml)

**Issue:**
> Dangerous use of eval() or exec(). These functions execute arbitrary 
Python code and should NEVER be used with user input.


**AI Explanation:**

This code violates SECURITY-001: Dangerous eval() Usage. 
The issue is that the `eval()` function is used to execute user-provided input (`token`), allowing arbitrary code execution. 
This matters because, as stated in the rule rationale, `eval()` is a code execution vulnerability that can lead to data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution. 
To fix it, use `ast.literal_eval()` for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation, as recommended in the rule remediation.

**💡 How to Fix:**
> Use ast.literal_eval() for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation

<details>
<summary>📝 Example Fix (click to expand)</summary>

```python
import ast
# Safe for literals only (strings, numbers, lists, dicts)
data = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
```

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. PATTERN-001

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:100` | **Rule:** [PATTERN-001](config/rules.yml)

**Message:** Mutable default argument detected! This is a classic Python bug.
Default values are created ONCE when the function is defined.


**Explanation:** This code violates PATTERN-001 because it uses a mutable default argument (`Dict = {}`) in the `store_user_sessions` function, which is created only once when the function is defined, not each time it's called. This matters because, as stated in the rule, all calls share the same dictionary, caus...
