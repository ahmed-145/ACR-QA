## 🔴 Critical Issues (High Severity)

⚠️ **These issues should be addressed immediately**

### 1. SECURITY-001 - security

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:126`

**Tool:** semgrep | **Rule:** [SECURITY-001](config/rules.yml)

**Issue:**
> Dangerous use of eval() or exec(). These functions execute arbitrary 
Python code and should NEVER be used with user input.


**AI Explanation:**

This code violates SECURITY-001 because it uses the `eval()` function to execute user-inputted code, which allows arbitrary code execution. This matters because, as stated in the rule rationale, `eval()` is a code execution vulnerability that can lead to data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution. To fix it, use `ast.literal_eval()` for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation, as recommended by the rule remediation.

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. PATTERN-001

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:100` | **Rule:** [PATTERN-001](config/rules.yml)

**Message:** Mutable default argument detected! This is a classic Python bug.
Default values are created ONCE when the function is defined.


**Explanation:** This code violates PATTERN-001: Mutable Default Argument, which is a best-practice rule with medium severity. 

1. WHAT is the issue: The issue is that the `store_user_sessions` function has a mutable default argument (`Dict = {}`), which is created only once when the function is defined, causing...
