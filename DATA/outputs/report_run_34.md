## 🔴 Critical Issues (High Severity)

⚠️ **These issues should be addressed immediately**

### 1. SECURITY-001 - security

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:126`

**Tool:** semgrep

**Issue:**
> Dangerous use of eval() or exec(). These functions execute arbitrary 
Python code and should NEVER be used with user input.


**AI Explanation:**

This code violates SECURITY-001: Dangerous eval() Usage. 
The issue is the use of the `eval()` function to execute user-provided input, which allows arbitrary code execution. 
This matters because, as stated in the rule, eval() is a code execution vulnerability that can lead to data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution (SECURITY-001: eval() is a code execution vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious code that will run with your application's privileges, leading to data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution.). 
To fix this, use `ast.literal_eval()` for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid dynamic evaluation (Use ast.literal_eval() for safe evaluation of literals, or redesign to avoid

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. PATTERN-001

**Location:** `TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues/auth_service.py:100`

**Message:** Mutable default argument detected! This is a classic Python bug.
Default values are created ONCE when the function is defined.


**Explanation:** This code violates PATTERN-001: Mutable Default Argument. 
The issue is that the function `store_user_sessions` uses a mutable default argument (`Dict = {}`), which is created only once when the function is defined, and all calls to the function share the same dictionary, causing unexpected behav...
